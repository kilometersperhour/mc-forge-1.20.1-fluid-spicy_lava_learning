Team member and I agree that for a proper Crash Landing Remake 
[https://www.reddit.com/r/CrashLanding2Modpack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrashLanding2Modpack/) 
the modpack needs flaming lava. First mod, here I go.

Inspiration comes from Thermal Expansion's Blazing Pyrotheum as used in the 
Crash Landing modpack for Minecraft 1.6.4. I'm learning as I go and trying to do what I can 
to create something similar without pulling directly from their source code, 
sort of as a challenge to myself to learn about the new (MC 1.19.x) Fluid API.

TE (pyrotheum) source code/repo linked here: 
[https://github.com/CoFH/ThermalFoundation-1.12-Legacy/blob/4f088d82a8e6fbd767cd4bc7d0c3428888a6ff2f/src/main/java/cofh/thermalfoundation/fluid/BlockFluidPyrotheum.java](https://github.com/CoFH/ThermalFoundation-1.12-Legacy/blob/4f088d82a8e6fbd767cd4bc7d0c3428888a6ff2f/src/main/java/cofh/thermalfoundation/fluid/BlockFluidPyrotheum.java)

If/when I do start referencing their code, I will be mindful of their DBaJ license 
and shall not compose my modded fluid using more than 50% of their code to do so.
